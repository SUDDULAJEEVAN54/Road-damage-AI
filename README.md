TrackX – Smart Road Damage Reporting & Rapid Response System

Overview:
TrackX is an IoT-based Smart Road Damage Reporting and Rapid Response System designed for the Solapur Municipal Corporation under the SAMVED Hackathon 2026 (Problem Statement ID: 001, Theme: Disaster Management). The system enables real-time monitoring of road conditions using sensors and AI-assisted analysis to detect potholes, humps, and road irregularities, ensuring faster maintenance and improved road safety. 


How it Works:

The system is mounted on municipal vehicles to continuously scan roads.

Ultrasonic sensors and an accelerometer detect road damage and vibrations.

A camera captures images of damaged areas, while a GPS module records the exact location.

A Raspberry Pi processes the data, classifies damage severity (Low/Medium/High), and uploads it to the cloud.

A municipal dashboard visualizes issues and assigns them to relevant departments with an escalation mechanism if delayed. 


Tech Stack:

Hardware: Raspberry Pi, Ultrasonic Sensor, MPU6050 Accelerometer, Camera Module, GPS, GSM

Software: Python, Wireless Communication, Cloud Analytics, Municipal Dashboard 


Feasibility & Reliability:

Can be installed on existing municipal vehicles.

Low-cost, scalable, and easy to deploy.

Mitigations include weatherproof sensors, night-vision cameras, and offline data storage with retransmission. 


Impact & Benefits:

Real-time road monitoring and faster municipal response.

Reduced road accidents and vehicle damage.

Improved urban infrastructure and safer roads.
